# rolling-stones-fan-site

The project is a proof of skill and knowledge with css, bootstrap and html. The site is a fan page for the Rolling Stones providing users with information about the band memmbers, current band tours and latest album.                                                

The website has a nav function on all pages allowing users to navigate from page to page without the need of clicking the back button.

The Nav function has 4 buttons the Logo, home, members and sign up.
    - The Logo is a home link returns the user to the index.html page
    - Home returns the user to the index.html page
    - Members is a dropdown that has several links to the band members bio page
    - Sign up takes the user to a page, where the user can sign up for a news letter. (site does not send out news letters)

Each band memmber has their own page (sub pages), the sub pages have a different layout then that of the index.html page.
    - By clicking on the profile pictures of the band memmbers users will be redirected to the index.html page 

Every page has a social links page to contact the site admin.
