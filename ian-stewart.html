                    <p>
                        Ian Andrew Robert Stewart was born at Kirklatch Farm, Pittenweem, East Neuk, Fife, Scotland, and raised in Sutton, London. Stewart (often called Stu) started playing piano when he was six. He took up the banjo and played with amateur groups on both instruments.
                        Stewart, who loved rhythm & blues, boogie-woogie, blues and big-band jazz, was first to respond to Brian Jones's advertisement in Jazz News of 2 May 1962 seeking musicians to form a rhythm & blues group. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards
                        joined in June, and the group, with Dick Taylor on bass and Mick Avory on drums, played their first gig under the name the Rollin' Stones at the Marquee Club on 12 July 1962. Richards described meeting Stewart thus: <br/><i>"He used to play boogie-woogie piano in jazz clubs, apart from his regular job. He blew my head off too, when he started to play. I never heard a white piano player play like that before."</i>                        <br/> By December 1962 and January 1963, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts had joined, replacing a series of bassists and drummers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During this period, Stewart had a job at Imperial Chemical Industries. None of the other band members had a telephone; Stewart said, <br/><i>"My desk at ICI was the headquarters of the Stones organisation. My number was advertised in Jazz News and I handled the Stones' bookings at work."</i>                        <br/>He also bought a van to transport the group and their equipment to their gigs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In early May 1963, the band's manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, said Stewart should no longer be onstage, that six members were too many for a popular group and that the older, burly, and square-jawed Stewart did not fit the image.He said Stewart could stay
                        as road manager and play piano on recordings. Stewart accepted this demotion. Richards said: <br/> <i>"Stu might have realised that in the way it was going to have to be marketed, he would be out of sync, but that he could still be a vital part. I'd probably have said, 'Well, fuck you', but he said 'OK, I'll just drive you around.' That takes a big heart, but Stu had one of the largest hearts around."</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stewart remained aloof from the band's drug abuse and partying lifestyle. <i>"I think he looked upon it as a load of silliness,"</i> said guitarist Mick Taylor. <br/><i>"I also think it was because he saw what had happened to Brian. I could tell from the expression on his face when things started to get a bit crazy during the making of Exile on Main Street. I think he found it very hard. We all did."</i><br/>                        Stewart played golf, and as road manager showed a preference for hotels with courses. Richards recalls: <br/><i>"We'd be playing in some town where there's all these chicks, and they want to get laid and we want to lay them. But Stu would have booked us into some hotel about ten miles out of town. You'd wake up in the morning and there's the links. We're bored to death looking for some action and Stu's playing Gleneagles."</i>
